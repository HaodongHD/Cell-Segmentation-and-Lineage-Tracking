# Cell-Segmentation-and-Lineage-Tracking
This repository provides a modular MATLAB pipeline for cell segmentation and cell lineage tracking based on probability maps generated by ilastik. The pipeline is optimized for time-lapse microscopy of thousands of cells and supports accurate centroid extraction, region-of-interest filtering, and frame-to-frame lineage tracking.
